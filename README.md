3806/6806 - Assignment 1

For this assignment you will want to create 2 files called RunMyMethods and MyMethods The first file RunMyMethods will contain the main that calls a menu method and will have a loop structure that will allow a user to choose what program they want to run. The menu displayed will look like this:
1. Product no negatives
2. Find Twelve
3. Max Min Avg
4. Letter Grade
5. Exit

The second file MyMethods will have methods in it that correspond to the menu shown above.  The methods should do the following:

1.	Write a program that will find the product of a collection of data values. The program should ignore all negative values and terminate when a zero value is encountered. 
2.	Write a program to read in a collection of integer values, and find and print the index of the first occurrence and last occurrence of the number 12. The program should print an index value of 0 if the number 12 is not found. The index is the sequence number of the data item 12. For example if the eighth data item is the only 12, then the index value 8 should be printed for the first and last occurrence. 
3.	Write a program to find the minimum, maximum, and average values of a collection of data values. The number of data values is unspecified. 
4.	Write a program to read in a collection of exam scores ranging in value from 0 to 100. The program should count and print the number of As 90 to 100., Bs 70 to 89., Cs 50 to 69., Ds 35 to 49. and Fs 0 to 34.. The program should also print each score and its letter grade. Use the following test data:
63 75 72 72 78 67 80 63 0 90 89 43 59 99 82 12 100 75
